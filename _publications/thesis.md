The thesis aims to showcase the economic benefits that predictive analysis and predictive marketing can bring to companies. It focuses on the impact of Big Data on corporate decision support systems, emphasizing the shift towards predictive analysis. The evolution from traditional business intelligence to predictive analysis is driven by the innovative use of efficient techniques within the significant datasets of Big Data. \

The primary goal is to offer companies a competitive edge through the strategic utilization of Big Data management techniques and successful predictive marketing strategies. In the current era, where data plays a crucial role in decision-making, the digital transformation of information into data, known as "datafication," is prominent. This transformation is facilitated by technological evolution, supporting the collection, analysis, and management of an ever-growing volume of data. \

The Big Data revolution is characterized by a shift from model-based to data-based approaches, emphasizing the observation of correlations within datasets rather than seeking causality between phenomena. The thesis discusses predictive analysis, predictive marketing, and their relationship, highlighting the success of companies like Amazon in leveraging data analysis techniques. \

In the second chapter, the thesis provides an overview of the Big Data phenomenon, conducting a SWOT analysis to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. It emphasizes the need for a change in the corporate approach, basing decisions on data rather than managerial intuition. The discussion extends to the recruitment of professionals capable of managing and interpreting large volumes of data. \

Finally, the thesis explores the crucial role of supply chain management in addressing the challenges posed by Big Data. Successful companies such as Dell and Walmart are presented as examples of organizations that have effectively adapted to this shift in perspective.
