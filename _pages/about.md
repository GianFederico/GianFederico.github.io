I've just completed my Master's Degree at University of Bari - CS for AI.

🔎Seeking opportunities to apply knowledge and contribute to the AI field.

In my free time I enjoy traveling✈️, PC-gaming🎮, Tabletop role-playing games(both as player and GameMaster)🎲, and working out after all — a healthy body fosters a healthy mind.💪 \
I love dogs and all kinds of animals🐾🍂
