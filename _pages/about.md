I earned my Master’s Degree in Computer Science for Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bari a little over a year ago. \
Now I’ve been working as a Data Scientist, driven by a genuine curiosity for AI and a desire to build things that make a real difference.

In my free time I enjoy traveling✈️, PC-gaming🎮, Tabletop role-playing games(both as player and GameMaster)🎲, and working out after all — a healthy body fosters a healthy mind.💪 \
I love dogs and all kinds of animals🐾🍂
