title: "Python - Face recognition: ML vs DL"
excerpt: "Machine Learning and Deep Learning models comparision for face recognition. "

In this project I've explored some of the ML and DL models in order to assess which one performs better on the task of facial recognition. \
I've compared several models, such as Random Forest, KNN, SVM and Logistic Regresison for Machine learing models, and a CNN for Deep Learning. \
The project follows a strict ML-Workflow, including phases such as pre-processing, training, testing and also the results discussion. \
Check it out at my [github repo](https://github.com/GianFederico/MD-repo-Machine_Learning).
