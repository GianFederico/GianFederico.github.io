In this project I implemented in Prolog a small expert system to assist individuals in identifying hardware-related problems with their PC. \
The system uses backtracking through the Prolog inference engine and prompts the user for the necessary information to explore all possible diagnoses. \
I've also implemented "*how*" and "*why*" questions in order to improve the level of trustworthiness and transparency of the system.

Check it out at my [github repo](https://github.com/GianFederico/SIDE-expert_sys_hardware_problems).
