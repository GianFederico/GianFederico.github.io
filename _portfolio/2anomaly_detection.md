In this study, the objective was to conduct a comparative analysis for anomaly detection using two different unsupervised techniques: an Autoencoder and a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). \ 
The study highlights the complementary strenghts of the models: \
The Autoencoder captures the structural deviations and the SOM focuses on color quantization and this makes the integration of both of them a natural recommendation for an holistc system.
