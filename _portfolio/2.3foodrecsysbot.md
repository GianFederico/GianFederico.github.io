This is my Master Thesis project, in collaboration with the research group [SWAP](http://www.di.uniba.it/~swap/). \
The idea was to build a recommender system and integrate it into a Telegram chatbot that focuses on persuasive explanations to encourage healthier eating habits. \
After a phase of user profiling, the bot is capable of:
- Recommend recipes;
- Give explanations about several aspects of the recipes recommended;
- Compare recipes according to some criteria;
